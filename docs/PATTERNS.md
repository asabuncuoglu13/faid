Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software development challenges. They help developers follow best practices, improving security, privacy, and maintainability. In traditional software development, object-oriented programming (OOP) design patterns define relationships between objects and classes to prevent common pitfalls. However, there is no widely established set of design patterns in the fairness domain.

## Defining Patterns for AI Fairness

ML pipelines differ from traditional software engineering pipelines in their interaction with data and the transition from experimentation to production. While MLOps shares foundational principles with software engineering, its organizational structures and workflows differ significantly.

To facilitate fairness-oriented design, we propose a risk-oriented framework that integrates evaluation and mitigation into the development process:

Just as OOP design patterns fit into the "world" of programming objects, fairness design patterns should align with achieving fair decision-making processes. The closest equivalent in fairness is the structured design of "policy" and "test" recipes for fairness evaluations. These can be integrated into structured unit tests within continuous integration pipelines, making fairness-oriented design more akin to unit testing design patterns.

Fairness lacks a universal definition and a single ideal quantification metric. However, by combining multiple fairness notions and metrics, we can develop a structured approach to enhancing fairness in AI applications.

## Design Patterns for Development Management

1. **Traceability** – Establish a traceable supply chain for ML codebases to identify the source of vulnerabilities.
2. **Responsibility** – Address sociotechnical issues throughout development and monitor societal impact post-deployment.
3. **Explainability** – Ensure AI system outputs are interpretable. This includes intuitive explanations combining multiple techniques so that stakeholders can understand and explain model decisions.
4. **Auditability** – Document clear KPIs and success metrics for fairness and safety goals.
5. **Digestibility** – Enhance visibility of decisions and vulnerabilities, making them accessible to diverse stakeholders.

## Design Patterns for Codebases

1. **Test Patterns** – Guidelines for setting up fairness monitoring tests.
2. **Structural Patterns** – Strategies for minimizing technical debt when integrating fairness solutions.
3. **Behavioral Patterns** – Proactive patterns that support applying test and structural patterns effectively. These can often be adapted from OOP by modifying code objects to higher-level fairness artifacts.

## The Ultimate Plan

Below is a structured framework for ensuring **traceability**, **auditability**, **explainability**, **digestibility**, and **responsibility** in ML development and deployment.

| **Aspect**            | **Traceability** | **Auditability** | **Explainability** | **Digestibility** | **Responsibility** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Goals**          | Track vulnerabilities across data, models, and processes. | Define KPIs for evaluating safety claims and compliance. | Ensure model behavior is interpretable for stakeholders. | Increase visibility and clarity of issues. | Consider sociotechnical risks and monitor societal impact. |
| **Tools**          | Version control (Git, DVC), lineage tracking (MLflow, W&B), dependency tools (SBOM, AIBOM). | Dashboards for KPI tracking (fairness, robustness). | Multiple explainability techniques focusing on "what if" scenarios. | Centralized monitoring with automated alerts. | Frameworks and participatory assessments for societal impact. |
| **Processes**      | Log every pipeline stage with unique IDs and metadata. | Evaluate KPIs with stakeholders regularly. | Document data and model decisions, highlighting biases. | Categorize and tag issues by severity, type, and ownership. | Conduct ethics reviews and stakeholder consultations. |
| **Monitoring**     | Automate logging for data provenance and pipeline runs. | Track KPI trends and adjust thresholds. | Generate reports with local and global explainability metrics. | Visualize pipeline health with summaries and drill-downs. | Continuously assess societal impact via feedback and audits. |
| **Communication**  | Provide stakeholders access to logs, documentation, and artifacts. | Publish safety performance reviews and incident analyses. | Share both technical and simplified insights. | Generate clear, digestible reports for diverse audiences. | Publish impact reports and host transparency forums. |
| **Education**      | Train teams on traceability tools and documentation best practices. | Educate stakeholders on KPI relevance. | Provide training on explainability tools. | Train teams to interpret alerts and dashboards. | Conduct workshops on sociotechnical risks and responsible AI. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Simulate vulnerabilities and refine traceability practices iteratively. | Refine KPIs based on feedback and audits. | Test and enhance explainability methods for usability. | Improve issue tracking and reporting. | Adjust tools and policies to address emerging societal risks. |

This structured approach ensures that fairness, accountability, and transparency are embedded throughout the ML development lifecycle.
