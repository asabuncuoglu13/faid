# Integrate customised FAID-like behaviour to your codebase

We designed FAID to integrate easily with experiment tracking tools (e.g. [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)), and record fairness-related data in a standardised and interoperable way. It is possible for developers to directly include FAID source code to their codebases to customise FAID's functionality based on their needs. In this document, we shared the potential integration approaches:

## Complete Library Integration


## Customised Logging Behaviour


## Customised Evaluation and Mitigation
