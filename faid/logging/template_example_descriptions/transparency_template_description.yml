information:
  name: "Algorithm for secondary school place allocation"
  description: "This algorithmic tool helps the council assign secondary school places to individual children."
  website_url: "www.ycouncil.gov.uk/residents/children-education-and-families/school-admissions"
  contact_email: "school-admissions@ycouncil.co.uk"

owner_and_responsibility:
  organisation_or_department: "Y council"
  team: "School Admissions Team (Education division)"
  senior_responsible_owner: "Head of Education Division"
  external_supplier_involvement: "Yes"
  data_access_terms: "Data access is restricted to the Y Council’s education department and schools. Data is stored in identifiable format for 4 years after which point it is anonymised."

description_and_rationale:
  detailed_description: "This algorithmic tool has been designed to apply admissions criteria to automatically assign a school space to each child in the main annual admissions round."
  scope: "This tool provides an initial allocation, but some individual circumstances will continue to be dealt with manually."
  benefit: "Improve efficiency in allocation of school spaces, reduce error rate, enable potential future changes in admissions criteria."
  previous_process: "The current process involves a mixture of manual and automated steps, managed through a complex set of internally developed spreadsheets."
  alternatives_considered: "Retaining the current approach was considered, but rejected due to significant risk of failure in the event of staff changes."

decision_making_process:
  process_integration: "The algorithm replaces the previous system used for managing allocations, adding a significantly greater degree of automation."
  provided_information: "The tool provides a recommendation for an allocation of children to available school places."
  frequency_and_scale_of_usage: "Each year, the automated process makes approx. 3000 decisions."
  human_decisions_and_review: "The automated process is reviewed every year to check its performance."
  required_training: "Each officer using the tool goes through an onboarding process that trains them on how to use the tool."
  appeals_and_review: "Existing appeals processes for school admissions will continue to apply."

tool_specification:
  system_architecture: "Find a system architecture diagram on our Github repository. Link: www.github.com/ycouncil/admissions-tool"
  phase: "Production"
  maintenance: "Maintenance and review of the tool occurs yearly prior to the operation of the tool."
  models: "The tool features two models: Z-NET and Y-Admissions."

model_specification:
  model_name: "Y-Admissions"
  model_version: "v4.1"
  model_task: "To allocate a fixed number of secondary school places to a set of applicants."
  model_input: "A dataset containing information about school applicants and a dataset containing the number and types of places offered by local state schools."
  model_output: "A dataset with school allocations for every applicant, along with brief written explanations for why each allocation has been given."
  model_architecture: "Y-Admissions is an optimisation-based automated planning model."
  model_performance: "Regular verification tests to ensure the model is executable and valid."
  datasets: "Datasets containing information about school applicants and datasets containing the number and types of places offered by local state schools."
  dataset_purposes: "Used to test the robustness and fairness of the model."

data_specification:
  source_data_name: "Y Council school applicants"
  data_modality: "Tabular"
  data_description: "These data provide information about school applicants which is relevant to Y Council’s admissions policy."
  data_quantities: "Each year, the dataset contains approximately 3000 samples with around 40 attributes each."
  sensitive_attributes: "Name, Age, Address, Sex, Religion, Disability, Parent or guardian name(s)"
  data_completeness_and_representative-ness: "Datasets are always ensured to be complete before being processed by the model."
  source_data_url: "N/A - the data contains personal data and cannot be made public."
  data_collection: "Collected retrospectively from existing schools and ongoing year-by-year data from students and schools."
  data_cleaning: "Pre-processing and cleaning performed by AI Tools UK."
  data_sharing_agreements: "A data sharing agreement has been put in place between Y Council and AI Tools UK."
  data_access_and_storage: "Data access is restricted to the Y Council’s education department and schools. Data is stored in identifiable format for 4 years after which point it is anonymised."

risks_mitigations_and_impact_assessments:
  impact_assessment: "See summary and full assessment under the link provided."
  risks_and_mitigations: "The tool’s computation of travel time might not always accurately reflect real world travel times for individual children. The council has set out a clear definition of how travel time is calculated on our website."
