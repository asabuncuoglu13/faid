Achieving fairness in product development is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders, including developers, business analysts, product owners, designers, and user researchers. FAID aims to help development teams to share fairness and safety related metadata, risks, and transparency reports easily and quickly. FAID also includes some helper functions to integrate common fairness libraries and frameworks such as fairlearn, AISI's inspect_ai, WEFE (word embedding fairness), etc.

The main idea of FAID is illustrated in below diagram:

Throughout the development lifecycle, a fairness log is recorded for very experiment, and it informs the model, data, risk and transparency logs in system level.

## Integrate FAID into your codebase

We created the FAID repository to support developers quickly integrate metadata management into their codebase. You can keep using your current experiment tracking tools (e.g. [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site), [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/), [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)), and record fairness-related data in a standardised and interoperable way. 

FAID is not a Python library. We don't want to abstract away the FAID features. Throughout the development process, developers should take some time and think about their model safety and how to monitor them. Then, they can directly include FAID source code to their codebases to customise FAID's functionality based on their needs. In this document, we shared the potential integration approaches:

### Logging

`ðŸ“‚ faid/logging` includes `ðŸ“‚ templates` and `ðŸ“‚ schema` for metadata storage, as well as utility files for initiating, populating and syncing metadata.

**Logging** is the core of FAID repository. It works on its own, and other functionalities depends on logging functions. So, you should start with integrating it and understanding its capabilities.


### Reports

`ðŸ“‚ faid/report` includes `ðŸ“‚ templates` and utility files for generating reports using the metadata information. The reports visualise the metadata in a friendly graphical format. Think about customising these templates to increase the visibility of "safety considerations."


### Scan

`ðŸ“‚ faid/scan` includes example data unit tests and model benchmark scanning functionalities.
