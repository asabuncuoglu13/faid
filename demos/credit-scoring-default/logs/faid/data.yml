    summary: This research aimed at the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan
      and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data
      mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive
      accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than
      the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because
      the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting
      Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default. With the real
      probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability
      of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result
      (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural
      network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept
      (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among
      the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that
      can accurately estimate the real probability of default.

    variable_info: "This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes\
      \ = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature\
      \ and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:\r\nX1: Amount\
      \ of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer\
      \ credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.\r\nX2: Gender (1 = male;\
      \ 2 = female).\r\nX3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high\
      \ school; 4 = others).\r\nX4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).\r\
      \nX5: Age (year).\r\nX6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past\
      \ monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the\
      \ repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August,\
      \ 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale\
      \ for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month;\
      \ 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months;\
      \ 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.\r\nX12-X17: Amount of bill statement\
      \ (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount\
      \ of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in\
      \ April, 2005. \r\nX18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount\
      \ paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount\
      \ paid in April, 2005.\r\n"
