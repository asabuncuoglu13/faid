  data_fields: "This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1,\
    \ No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used\
    \ the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:\r\nX1: Amount of the given\
    \ credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her\
    \ family (supplementary) credit.\r\nX2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).\r\nX3:\
    \ Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).\r\
    \nX4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).\r\nX5: Age (year).\r\
    \nX6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records\
    \ (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September,\
    \ 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status\
    \ in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay\
    \ duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . .\
    \ .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and\
    \ above.\r\nX12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill\
    \ statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005;\
    \ . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005. \r\nX18-X23: Amount of\
    \ previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount\
    \ paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.\r\n"
