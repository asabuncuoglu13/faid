data_fields: "This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1,\
  \ No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used\
  \ the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:\r\nX1: Amount of the given\
  \ credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her\
  \ family (supplementary) credit.\r\nX2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).\r\nX3: Education\
  \ (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).\r\nX4: Marital\
  \ status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).\r\nX5: Age (year).\r\nX6 - X11:\
  \ History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April\
  \ to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005;\
  \ X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in\
  \ April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly;\
  \ 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 =\
  \ payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.\r\
  \nX12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement\
  \ in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17\
  \ = amount of bill statement in April, 2005. \r\nX18-X23: Amount of previous payment\
  \ (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August,\
  \ 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.\r\n"
