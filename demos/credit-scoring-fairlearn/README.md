# Credit Loan Decisions

This example is a tutorial adapted from the [fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) library. It demonstrates how to assess and mitigate unfairness in credit models using the Fairlearn toolkit.The notebook addresses fairness considerations in credit loan decisions, referencing a real-world incident involving Apple's credit card. 

We modified this tutorial to provide a comprehensive workflow for addressing fairness in AI systems using FAID metadata flow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and mitigation.
