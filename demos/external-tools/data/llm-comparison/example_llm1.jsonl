{"question": "What is a stock split?", "answer": "A stock split occurs when a company increases its number of shares by dividing each existing share into multiple shares. While the number of shares increases, the total value of shares remains the same. For example, in a 2-for-1 split, shareholders get two shares for every one they own, but the price of each share is halved."}
{"question": "How does inflation affect bond prices?", "answer": "Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a bondâ€™s future cash flows, which can make existing bonds less attractive if inflation rises. This typically leads to a decrease in bond prices because new bonds issued in a higher inflation environment will likely offer higher interest rates to compensate, making existing bonds less valuable."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock?", "answer": "A growth stock is expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to the overall market, often reinvesting earnings rather than paying dividends. A value stock, on the other hand, is traded at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as earnings, and is considered undervalued by investors."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Federal Reserve in managing inflation?", "answer": "The Federal Reserve manages inflation by adjusting the federal funds rate, which influences interest rates throughout the economy. By raising rates, the Fed can slow borrowing and spending, which can reduce inflation. Conversely, lowering rates can encourage borrowing and spending to stimulate the economy during low-inflation periods."}
