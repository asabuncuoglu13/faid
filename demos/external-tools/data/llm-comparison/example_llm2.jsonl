{"question": "What is a stock split?", "answer": "A stock split is when a company divides its shares into more shares. You still own the same total value, but now you have more shares at a lower price. For example, if a company does a 2-for-1 split, you get two shares for every one, but each share is worth half as much."}
{"question": "How does inflation affect bond prices?", "answer": "Inflation makes the money you get from a bond worth less in the future. This usually causes bond prices to drop because newer bonds may pay higher interest to keep up with inflation."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock?", "answer": "Growth stocks are from companies that are expected to grow fast, but they may not pay dividends. Value stocks are from companies that seem cheaper than they should be based on their financials, and they often pay dividends."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Federal Reserve in managing inflation?", "answer": "The Federal Reserve controls inflation by changing interest rates. If they raise rates, it makes borrowing more expensive, slowing down spending, which helps lower inflation. If they lower rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, encouraging spending to boost the economy."}
