    "# Using Subgroup Discovery for Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dubowski's thesis [^thesis], fairsd is used to explore fairness in general throughout the ML pipeline. The author presents a conceptual framework with functional requirements to include fairsd as the core component of fairness experiments. In this document, we summarise the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework emphasizes identifying subgroups with predicted risk scores of lower **epistemic value**. It is model's ability to provide accurate and reliable predictions for those groups is compromised. Framework's key aspects can be listed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predictive bias arises from biases in data collection and processing, leads to quality-of-service harms. These harms manifest as discrepancies in the model's performance across different subgroups.\n",
    "- To quantify the harms, a carefully selected quality metric is essential. A good metric is using the average group log loss, as it captures both the model's discriminatory ability (how well it separates different risk levels) and its calibration (how accurately its predicted probabilities align with actual outcomes).\n",
    "- Using subgroup discovery techniques, particularly **fair subgroup discovery (FairSD)**, to automatically identify subgroups that exhibit lower performance compared to the overall dataset. This approach helps uncover potential harms affecting groups defined not just by single attributes, but also by intersections of multiple attributes (addressing the issue of \"fairness gerrymandering\").\n",
    "- Model loss explanations can help to investigate the sources of predictive bias. By analyzing discrepancies in how individual features contribute to the model's loss for different subgroups compared to the baseline (the entire dataset), data scientists can pinpoint features potentially introducing bias.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is a circular flow encompassing these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify potential harms.\n",
    "2. Select a quality metric.\n",
    "3. Identify relevant harmed subgroups using the chosen metric and SD techniques.\n",
    "4. Identify the most informative features based on model loss explanations.\n",
    "5. Compare loss contribution distributions between the subgroup and full dataset to pinpoint discrepancies indicative of predictive bias.\n",
    "6. Take bias mitigation actions based on the insights gained, which might involve adjusting data collection, preprocessing, or model training. This feeds back into the framework, leading to a new iteration of assessment.\n",

    "A subgroup discovery can reveal these key results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identifying Harmed Subgroups:** Automatically searching for subgroups within the dataset that exhibit the most significant discrepancies in model performance compared to the overall population. This helps pinpoint groups potentially disadvantaged by the model's predictions. \n",
    "* **Addressing Fairness Gerrymandering:** An SG discovery can reveal \"fairness gerrymandering,\" where subgroups experiencing harm may be hidden when only considering individual sensitive attributes like race or gender.\n",
    "* **Choice of Quality Metric:** The choice of quality metric in the subgroup discovery process is crucial for defining and identifying the specific type of harm being assessed. For instance, using average group log loss as the quality metric focuses on identifying subgroups experiencing lower epistemic value in their predicted risk scores, meaning their predictions are less accurate and potentially more miscalibrated.\n",
    "* **Uncovering Predictive Bias:** The discrepancies in model performance revealed by subgroup discovery can point to potential sources of predictive bias. If a subgroup consistently exhibits lower performance, it suggests certain features may be less informative for that group, leading to biased predictions. For example, if the subgroup \"occupation = 'Exec-managerial' AND capital-gain = (-infinite,0]\" shows significant underperformance, it suggests these combined features may be less informative or biased for this specific group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's assume that, after our analysis, we would like to change the quality metric to average group log loss. We need to link our fairness experiment results to model log in this case. Further, we should select the important findings to the model log so that other developers can also benefit from these findings. For example, comparing the subgroup \"native-country = 'Mexico'\" to \"native-country = 'Mexico' AND race = 'White'\" revealed that the model performed better for white individuals within the Mexican subgroup, highlighting a concerning disparity."
